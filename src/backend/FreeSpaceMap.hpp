/**
 * @class FreeSpaceMap
 * @brief Manages free and used pages in the database via a bitmap-based paging system.
 *
 * The FreeSpaceMap tracks allocation status for all pages in the database. It uses a linked list of
 * FSMPage instances, each of which tracks the allocation bitmap for a fixed number of pages (e.g., 32).
 *
 * Each FSMPage is stored as a page in the database and cached via PageCache. The first bit (bit 0) of
 * each FSMPage refers to the page itself; all other bits represent usable page IDs.
 *
 * This class does not perform any disk I/O directly. It relies on PageCache to retrieve or store FSMPages.
 * It also does not create new FSMPagesâ€”it assumes the caller (usually Pager) checks if space is full
 * (via isFull()) and creates new FSMPages before calling allocBit(). New pages can be linked using
 * linkFSMPage().
 *
 * This class does not perform bounds checking on pageIDs for performance. It is the caller's
 * responsibility to ensure correctness.
